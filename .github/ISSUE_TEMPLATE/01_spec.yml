        You‚Äôre opening an issue because this library diverges from the [CSSOM API Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/).
        
        Since this library expands on the specification, these issues should specifically be identifying _conflicts_ with the specification. Additional functionality is the intent of this library, so they are not specification issues.
